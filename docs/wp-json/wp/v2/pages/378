The taste is similar to cauliflower and cabbage heart, but slightly sweeter. It is an excellent candidate for stuffing, and the Indian-inspired spices in the goat go beautifully with the flavor and texture of the kohlrabi.<\/p>\n<p>4\u00a0medium kohlrabi bulbs<\/p>\n<p>1 lb. ground goat (lamb or beef would be great also)<\/p>\n<p>2 cloves garlic, minced<\/p>\n<p>1 large onion, diced<\/p>\n<p>1 medium tomato, peeled, seeded, and chopped<\/p>\n<p>1 tbsp coconut oil or ghee<\/p>\n<p>1 tsp ground cumin<\/p>\n<p>1 tsp ground coriander<\/p>\n<p>1 tsp ground ginger<\/p>\n<p>1 tsp turmeric<\/p>\n<p>1\/4 tsp cayenne<\/p>\n<p>1\/2 tsp chili powder<\/p>\n<p>1\/4 cup cilantro, chopped<\/p>\n<p>Peel kohlrabi. Slice the bottom to give each bulb a flat surface to sit on. Slice the top off and scrape out the center of the bulb, leaving a 1\/4 inch shell. This is most easily done with a melon-baller if you have one, but a spoon will work also. Chop up the filling that you removed, and set aside for later. Bring water in a large pot to a boil, and boil kohlrabi shells until a fork can be inserted into flesh. Remove from water and set aside.<\/p>\n<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook until slightly soft. Add lamb and garlic and cook until lamb is browned throughout. Add spiced and stir well to coat meat. Add tomato, cilantro and reserved kohlrabi filling. Simmer for 10 minutes, adding a little water or stock if mixture becomes too dry.<\/p>\n<p>Spoon lamb filling into kohlrabi shells and place in a baking dish. Bake for 15 minutes-20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Additional note: If your kohlrabi bulbs came with the greens attached, you can chop up the small, tender leaves and throw them in the lamb mixture as well when you add the tomato, cilantro, and kohlrabi.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Oven Roasted Kohlrabi<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Preheat oven to 400.

This CSA blog suggested a South American Aji Sauce that uses a whole head of lettuce to create a mayonnaise-based sauce. The basic method is:<\/p>\n<p>Take your cored, washed head of lettuce and place it in a blender or food processor with one or two seeded jalape\u00f1os, three to five chopped green onions salt and pepper to taste, cilantro (or other herbs you might prefer) and 1\/4 cup of mayonnaise. Whirr it around until you have a pourable sauce. If to thick you might want to add one to two tablespoons of red wine vinegar or lime juice.<\/p>\n<p>Serving suggestions:<\/p>\n<p>top grilled chicken or steak<\/p>\n<p>toss in a salad (yeah more salad!)<\/p>\n<p>dress chopped vegetables<\/p>\n<p>dip for bread or chips.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lettuce Soup<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>Carolyn Cope writes\u00a0Umami Girl\u00a0and manages a CSA in New Jersey<\/em><\/p>\n<p>1\/4 cup olive oil<\/p>\n<p>1 medium onion, diced<\/p>\n<p>10 large outer leaves of Romaine lettuce, torn into pieces<\/p>\n<p>1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced<\/p>\n<p>3 cups chicken stock<\/p>\n<p>1 1\/2 teaspoons salt<\/p>\n<p>1\/4 cup heavy cream<\/p>\n<p>Pinch of ground nutmeg<\/p>\n<p>1 tablespoon lemon juice<\/p>\n<p>1 tablespoon parsley leaves<\/p>\n<p>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste<\/p>\n<p><strong>Procedure<br \/> <\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a 4-quart saucepan.

When well dried, chop up like you would for a salad and pack loosely in a quart mason jar with a metal lid and ring. Will stay nice in fridge for several days and often weeks. It is also very handy for when you want to make a salad but are running short on time.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes in the spring we seem to get an abundance of lettuces. One way to use the sturdier head lettuces such as romaine types, is for lettuce wraps or substitute for taco shells. Might be a little messy but yummy just the same.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Removing stowaways<\/strong><br \/>\nEating food straight from the garden and not treated with pesticides is wonderful, but sometimes you will find little stowaways in your broccoli, lettuce, cabbage, etc. Inspect carefully but it also helps to soak the veggies in some clean cool water with salt added. This seems to draw out the little critters. May need to repeat a few times for broccoli and lettuces.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cherry tomatoes<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen we get cherry tomatoes and it seems overwhelming, save them for use in winter. Wash and dry thoroughly. Place on a cookie sheet and freeze until solid. Toss into freezer bags. Take out as needed to use in soups\/stews and pasta recipes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kale: Freeze it<\/strong><br \/>\nFor our family, we think kale is easier to use and is less bitter if frozen first. It is easy to freeze kale. Wash well. Remove stems and dry leaves thoroughly. Place in freezer bag and store in freezer. When ready to use, just break up kale while in freezer bag. The more you crush them with your hands the finer the pieces. Ready to cook.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Onions: Carmelize and serve with kale<\/strong><br \/>\nAnother tip I received from a coworker was to carmelize onions with some garlic and honey. After the onions are carmelized, add kale and stir till coated. Add a smidgin of baking soda, and then broth or water. Cook till tender. She says the baking soda helps break down the kale and also takes away the bitterness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chard<\/strong><br \/>\nChard leaves are a good substitute for cabbage and grape leaves when making cabbage rolls or stuffed grape leaves. They can be slightly blanched before rolling or rolled without blanching. Stuff as you would for these recipes and bake according to directions<\/p>\n<p><strong>Storing herbs and greens<\/strong><br \/>\nMint keeps really well in a glass of water in the windowsill with some sun. Store greens after washing and spinning dry in a bowl with a paper towel covering and tucked in tight around greens. Keep asparagus in a jar of water like you would flowers. The same is true of chard and kale. Try these tips to prolong the life of your produce.<\/p>\n<p>Storing asparagus and some herbs: To prolong the life of your asparagus and some herbs, place in a tall container with about 1 inch water in bottom of container (e.g. herb saver or pitcher works well). Cover with lid to container or plastic bag. Store in fridge. Do not store at back of fridge as this area gets the coldest and might cause freezing of tops of produce.<\/p>\n<p>Looking for a way to use those herbs Levi sends but not quite sure what to do with them? Try making herb infused vinegars. Take a glass canning jar or any recycle glass jar with a plastic lid and stuff washed herbs into jar. Pour white vinegar over herbs to top of jar. Cover with plastic lid and let sit in sunny area for about 4-6 weeks. Chives make a wonderful vinegar: the pink flowers give it a nice color and make the vinegar a little sweet. Excellent in salad dressings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Honey<\/strong><br \/>\nUsing local produce and food products may help you decrease your allergy symptoms. Many people use local honey daily and find their symptoms are subsiding. Another good reason to join a CSA!
