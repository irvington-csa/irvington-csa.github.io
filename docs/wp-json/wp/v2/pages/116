Good land stewardship, sustainable farming methods and respect for biodiversity are practiced. No synthetic chemicals are used on soil or plants. Members pay a set fee in May of each year to receive a season&#8217;s worth of vegetables throughout the growing season. Once a week, members pick up their orders at a designated location. Contents of weekly baskets vary, depending on what vegetables are ready for harvest. Whatever their baskets contain, Irvington CSA members always enjoy the very best fresh, natural produce\u2014straight from the farm.<\/p>\n<h3>Season and share<\/h3>\n<p>Deliveries are expected to begin mid-May and continue for 25 weeks.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Each share is designed for a family that likes to cook or couples or individuals who eat a lot of vegetables. A full share\u2019s value is about $25 per week. Our produce is mostly vegetables (asparagus, carrots, kale, salad mix, potatoes, sweet potatoes, red peppers, broccoli, zucchini, to name a few). We do get some fruits like strawberries, blackberries, watermelon and cantaloupe. At first shares are smaller\u2014mostly lettuce, asparagus and berries. But as the weather warms, your share basket will overflow with corn, tomatoes, peppers and other veggies. Each week\u2019s share gives you a chance to sample Indiana-grown vegetables.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Price and payment<\/h3>\n<p>A full share is $650 and a half share is $415; payments are made to the farmer, Levi Fisher Jr. Payment options:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">1. Pay all of your full or half share up front.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">2. Pay half of share on May 1 and half by July 1.<br \/>\n<\/span>3.

Please arrive as early as possible to pick up your share. If you\u2019re going to be late, please text the wrangler for that day. We will donate shares that are not picked up by 6:30 p.m. to the food pantry Downey hosts each Thursday. Please be courteous to your fellow member-volunteers, who will be distributing shares. Just like you, they will be eager to begin their Friday festivities at 6:30 p.m.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>If you\u2019ll be away<\/h3>\n<p>Please let us know in advance that you won\u2019t be picking up your share. That way, volunteers won\u2019t wait around for you on Friday night. Please text that week\u2019s wrangler or email <a href=\"mailto:irvingtonagriculture@gmail.com\">irvingtonagriculture@gmail.com<\/a> at least three days in advance. You have two options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arrange to have someone else pick up your share.<\/li>\n<li>Donate your share to others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please note that shares won&#8217;t be held for you without notice and you will not be reimbursed for forfeited shares. Thank you for understanding!<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h3>Volunteering<\/h3>\n<p>To run the Irvington CSA, shareholders take part in making it work. Each shareholder works at least two pickups per season, per share. <a href=\"http:\/\/irvingtoncsa.org\/volunteer\/\">Learn about volunteering.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Special orders<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to our weekly share basket, there are special order items available each week for purchase, such as, eggs, maple syrup, beef, honey, flour, flowers, etc. Special orders are placed by responding to the weekly email. For the safety of our members, all payments will take place via PayPal beginning in 2020.<\/p>\n<h3>Sharing a share<\/h3>\n<p>If you decide to split a share, it\u2019s usually easier if it\u2019s with a friend or neighbor, but we can make introductions if we have others needing a partner. If you are sharing a share, both share partners do not need to be present at pick-up. However, the full share must be picked up. This is for practical as well as health reasons. For example, if the week\u2019s full share consists of 5 red peppers, it is too complicated for the volunteers to keep track of whether you took 2 or 3 peppers or wanted to cut one in half and leave the other for your share partner. Another scenario is that a full share might contain a cantaloupe. It would be a health risk for us to allow members to leave a half a cantaloupe out for hours waiting for the other share partner.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Communication<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Email:<\/strong> We send weekly email updates about each week\u2019s produce, volunteers and wrangler. <strong>Facebook:<\/strong> Friend us on Facebook! Look for Irvington CSA. <strong>Privacy Policy:<\/strong><strong> \u00a0<\/strong>We use your personal information only for the purposes of communicating about the CSA program. Your information will not be given away to solicitors or spammers.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Fellowship and fun<\/h3>\n<p>We encourage you to get to know other members of the CSA during pick-up and form your own network of people who would be willing to pick up for each other if the need arises.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Cancellation policy<\/h3>\n<p>Because our farmer and his family depend on this program as a vital part of their yearly income, we cannot refund shares once members have signed up. However, members can transfer their shares to someone else. Please contact the CSA to work out a plan.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Forces of nature<\/h3>\n<p>Farmer Levi can\u2019t control the weather and other factors that impact how vegetables grow. These forces of nature are beyond the control of the Irvington CSA and may affect your share size. For example, some seasons are not good for corn, so we receive less of it. Some seasons we have corn coming out of our ears.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><em>Membership agreement<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><em>With my payment and email confirmation, I commit to becoming a member of the Irvington CSA.
